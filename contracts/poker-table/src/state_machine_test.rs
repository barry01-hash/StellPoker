//! Property-based state-machine tests for the betting round transitions
//! (issue #292). These tests model the betting round as a formal state
//! machine, generate random legal action sequences, and verify:
//!
//!   * **State transitions are valid** — only legal phase edges are taken
//!     and the phase rank is monotonically non-decreasing.
//!   * **Invariant checks pass** — chip conservation holds after every
//!     action, no balance ever goes negative, and `current_turn` always
//!     references an active, non-folded, non-all-in seat inside a betting
//!     phase.
//!   * **Terminal states are reachable** — for any sequence of intents we
//!     always reach either `Showdown` (matching bets through River) or
//!     `Settlement` (fold-chain) within a bounded number of moves.
//!
//! The tests drive `betting::process_action` directly against an in-memory
//! `TableState`, deliberately skipping the deal/reveal/showdown ZK proof
//! path (covered elsewhere by the lifecycle tests). They run inside the
//! `proptest!` macro with the Soroban test budget reset
//! (`cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited()`) so the many generated
//! cases are not throttled by metering.
