//! PostgreSQL advisory-lock-based leader election for coordinator HA deployments
//! (issue #266).
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! When multiple coordinator replicas run behind a load balancer (e.g. AWS ALB),
//! only one of them should be the **leader** — the one that accepts new game
//! sessions, orchestrates MPC proofs, and writes to Soroban. Followers serve
//! read-only endpoints (health, stats, table state) and return `503 Not Leader`
//! for write operations.
//!
//! Leader election uses a PostgreSQL *session-level advisory lock*:
//!
//! - `pg_try_advisory_lock(LOCK_KEY)` — non-blocking; returns `true` if the
//!   calling session acquired the lock, `false` if another session already holds it.
//! - The lock is tied to the *physical database session* (TCP connection). When
//!   the leader process exits or loses its database connection, the lock is
//!   released automatically and a follower can acquire it within `POLL_INTERVAL`.
//!
//! ## Advisory lock vs. `pg_advisory_lock`
//!
//! `pg_advisory_lock` (blocking) would stall the startup of new replicas.
//! `pg_try_advisory_lock` (non-blocking) lets followers start immediately and
//! serve read-only traffic while polling for leadership.
//!
//! ## etcd alternative
//!
//! If the deployment does not include PostgreSQL, etcd can be used instead
//! (see [`LeaderBackend`] trait). The `pg_try_advisory_lock` approach is the
//! default because the coordinator already depends on Postgres.
