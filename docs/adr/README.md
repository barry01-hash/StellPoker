# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Stellar Poker.

An ADR captures a significant architectural decision: the context that led to it, the options that were considered, and the rationale for the choice made. ADRs are immutable once accepted — if a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one rather than replacing it.
